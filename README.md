# Data pipeline application using Flask Web framework

## Building a data pipeline using FLASK API for titanic dataset containerizing the application using docker

## Setup:
 
* Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ depending on the Operating System.

* Install Flask: pip install Flask


## Explanation:

* In this project, the data pipeline machine learning model predicts whether the person has survived or not. The results of the model will be as follows:
If survived is true then 1 or if survived is false the result is 0.

*  The machine learning model is then integrated with the FLASK Web API along with Flasgger(web framework) as a front-end application for a better user experience of viewing the results.

* This entire application is then containerized using docker, so that everyone can use the application irrespective of the underlying software or hardware configuration.
